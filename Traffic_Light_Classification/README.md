## Project Overview

Traffic Light Classifier
In this project, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic
lights! You'll be given a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green.

To pass this project, your classifier must be >90% accurate and never classify any red lights as green; it's likely that
you'll need to improve the accuracy of your classifier by changing existing features or adding new features. I'd also
encourage you to try to get as close to 100% accuracy as possible!
